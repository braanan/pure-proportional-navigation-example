# Pure Proportional Navigation Guidance Law Example in MATLAB

* This repo includes a MATLAB script containing an over-simplified kinematics simulation that demonstrates the use of pure pro-nav for target pursuit. 

* All positions, velocities, and angels are in the inertial frame (NED)

* Kinematics assume all commands are executed perfectly and immediately.

* The use case considered in the script is USBL tracking with an AUV, so disturbances from ocean currents can be introduced.
